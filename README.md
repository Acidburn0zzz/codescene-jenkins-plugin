[![Latest release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/empear-analytics/codescene-jenkins-plugin.svg)](https://github.com/empear-analytics/codescene-jenkins-plugin/releases/latest)

A jenkins plugin for
[CodeScene](http://www.empear.com/products/codescene-on-premise/) by Empear.


CodeScene detects potential maintenance problems and early warnings in your
codebase. The earlier you can react to those findings, the better. That’s why
CodeScene offers integration points that let you incorporate the analysis
results into your build pipeline.

This plugin lets you use CodeScene’s Delta Analysis to catch potential problems
before they are delivered to your main branch.
