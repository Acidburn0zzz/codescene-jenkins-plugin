# codescene-jenkins-plugin
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/swehacker/codescene-jenkins-plugin.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/swehacker/codescene-jenkins-plugin)

A jenkins plugin for [CodeScene](http://www.empear.com/products/codescene-on-premise/) by Empear.

CodeScene detects potential maintenance problems and early warnings in your codebase. The earlier you can react to those findings, the better. That’s why CodeScene offers integration points that let you incorporate the analysis results into your build pipeline.

This plugin lets you use CodeScene’s Delta Analysis to catch potential problems before they are delivered to your main branch.
