    All commits in the build branch of the job, not present in the branch/ref specified by <em>Base Revision</em> (i.e.
    the history difference between the job ref and <em>Base Revision</em>) will be used for a single delta analysis.

    A common workflow is to build <code>feature/*</code> branches in Jenkins jobs, and use <code>origin/master</code>
    as <em>Base Revision</em>. This effectively runs delta analyses on entire feature branches.
